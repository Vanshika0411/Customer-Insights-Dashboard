* Performing joins
* Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
* Filtering & grouping
* Finding customer trends

### **🐍 Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy)**

* Data cleaning
* Removing duplicates
* Handling missing values
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature analysis

### **📊 Power BI**

* Creating dashboards
* Using slicers, cards & KPIs
* Creating visuals (Bar charts, Line charts, Donut charts)
* Interactive filters

---

## 📌 **4. Dataset Description**

The dataset includes:

* Customer ID
* Age
* Gender
* Product Category
* Purchase Amount
* Date of Purchase
* Payment Method
* Location

It helps analyze **which customers buy what, when, and how much**.

## 📌 **5. Steps Followed in the Project**

### **🔹 Step 1: Data Collection**

* Gathered raw customer data
* Imported it into SQL and Python

---

### **🔹 Step 2: Data Cleaning (Python)**

Performed:

* Removing null values
* Fixing incorrect data types
* Removing duplicates
* Normalizing columns

---

### **🔹 Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)**

Analyzed:

* Most purchased product categories
* Age groups and gender buying patterns
* Total revenue trends
* Monthly purchase behavior

Created visual plots for better understanding.

---

### **🔹 Step 4: SQL Analysis**

Used SQL to perform:

* Total sales calculation
* Top 10 customers
* Highest selling categories
* Month-wise analysis
* Yearly trends

---

### **🔹 Step 5: Power BI Dashboard Building**

Built a professional dashboard including:

* KPIs → Total Sales, Total Orders, Avg Purchase Value
* Bar Charts → Category-wise sales
* Line Chart → Monthly trends
* Donut Chart → Payment method distribution
* Filters → Location, Gender, Category

---

### **🔹 Step 6: Insights & Findings**

Key insights include:

* Most revenue comes from *top product categories*
* A specific age group purchases the most
* Some locations show higher customer engagement
* Trending buying months and seasonal patterns

---

### **🔹 Step 7: Conclusions**

This dashboard provides quick and meaningful customer insights.
It helps businesses understand customer behavior and improve their decisions.
